    <h2>About</h2>
    <p>My name is Tetiana.</p>
    <p>
      I am currently a Code The Dream student and started my software
      development journey about 2 years ago.
    </p>
    <p>
      Before coming to CTD, I worked for over 5 years in data engineering,
      analysis, testing, and utilizing accounting software programs. This
      experience tested my data-driven skills and sparked my interest in web
      programming.
    </p>
    <p>
      I have a strong passion for developing applications that make a real
      difference in solving everyday problems. To me, software development is
      more than just coding; it's about crafting solutions that tackle
      challenges people and communities encounter.
    </p>
    <p>If I am not coding, you can find me hiking, cooking, or camping.</p>
