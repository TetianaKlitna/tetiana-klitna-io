<h1>Tetiana Klitna</h1>
<h2>About</h2>
<p>My name is Tetiana. 
<p>I am currently a Code The Dream student and started my software development journey about 2 years ago.
<p>Before coming to CTD, I worked for over 5 years in data engineering, analysis, testing, and utilizing accounting software programs. This experience tested my data-driven skills and sparked my interest in web programming.
<p>I have a strong passion for developing applications that make a real difference in solving everyday  problems. To me, software development is more than just coding; it's about crafting solutions that tackle challenges people and communities encounter.
<p>If I am not coding, you can find me hiking, cooking, or camping.
